    "summary": "Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Santiago. I'm a 25y/o DevSecOps engineer with a background in Computer Science. I mainly do security work, but I'm a technical generalist with strong automation skills. I mainly like to work with linux and linux-adjacent technologies but also enjoy infrastructure and DevOps work. I've worked in several different roles, including as a DevSecOps Engineer, Penetration Tester, and WebApp Developer. My focus over the past couple of years has been learning about technologies I'm interested in (Kubernetes, Rust, Linux) and in general improving my technical knowledge. I'm a very curious person and as such have experimented with many different technologies; This includes but is not limited to building and hosting my own Proxmox server at home, running Arch Linux as my main OS, and developing my own containerized services in Docker. I like to work with a technical team that I can rely on and love to be the least knowledgeable person in the room. However, I'm also more than happy to help mentor and guide others where I can. If you're interested in my work, please feel free to check out my github and/or contact me using my email in the top right!",
